                                <p>What are the best MLB ballparks? We rank them from top to bottom in our annual Best
                                        of the Ballparks MLB rankings, updated for the 2019 season.
                                        Everyone has a favorite ballpark, whether it be the site of one’s first MLB
                                        game, home to a memorable moment, or the hometown favorite where we’ve spent the
                                        most time over the years. In this list, we’re taking a step back from emotional
                                        choices and ranking the MLB ballparks from top to bottom. We don’t expect
                                        everyone to agree with our choices, and you’ll have the chance to register your
                                        agreement or disagreement when we launch the Best of the Ballparks 2019 vote
                                        next Monday.</p>

                                <p>One thing to note here. We’ve broken down this list into three subcategories. The top
                                        seven MLB ballparks are in a league of their own, and one could argue that any
                                        of the seven could be deemed the best in all of baseball: really, there’s not
                                        much sunlight between PNC Park and Dodger Stadium when you look at factors like
                                        fan amenities, architectural distinction, and history. The next 17 ballparks are
                                        all very good ballparks, but they don’t measure up to the best in MLB. (If your
                                        favorite is in this group, more power to you, and we hope you enjoy the ballpark
                                        experience.) And the bottom six ballparks are either slated for replacement or
                                        acknowledged by teams as needing plenty TLC.</p>

                        <h2 class="article_header">Top 5 Stadiums to see</h2>
                        
                        <div class="news_articles">
                                <p>#1 PNC Park A past winner in the fan vote for Best of the Ballparks, the home of the
                                        Pittsburgh Pirates is a beloved facility that combines the perfect site, lots of
                                        architectural distinction, and many memorable fan amenities that are upgraded
                                        annually. There are plenty of reminders of the rich history of the Bucs, while
                                        walking across the Roberto Clemente Bridge on a game day is a memorable
                                        experience for Pirates fans. Add to that the above-average concessions,
                                        virtually perfect sightlines and a commitment from the team to perform annual
                                        upgrades, and you have our pick for the best ballpark in baseball. (2018 rank:
                                        #1)</p>

                                <p>#2 Wrigley Field The second-oldest ballpark in the majors is also turning into one of
                                        the newest ones, as the Cubs are in the last stretches of a $550-million
                                        modernization plan that upgraded fan experiences and player facilities. Opening
                                        as Weeghman Park in 1914 as the home of the Chi-Feds, Wrigley Field has been
                                        altered over the years—the grandstand was split apart and expanded in 1923, a
                                        second deck was added in 1926-1927, and the legendary bleachers were rebuilt in
                                        2005-2006—but even with all the changes, you get the sense that the ballpark,
                                        for the most part, remains true to architect Zachary Taylor Davis’s original
                                        vision. Today there’s something for everyone at Wrigley Field: a private club
                                        for high rollers, grandstand seating close to the action, and outfield bleachers
                                        for those more interested in a social scene than a baseball game. More clubs and
                                        social spaces debuted in 2019, as the 1060 Project draws to a close. (2018 rank:
                                        #3)</p>

                                <p>#3 Oracle Park Could there be any better location for baseball in San Francisco than
                                        a waterfront site used to great advantage by the ballpark architects? The views
                                        from the grandstand and outfield concourse of San Francisco and the Bay are
                                        tremendous, and walking around the ballpark is a delight. The Giants’ rich
                                        history, as well as San Francisco’s PCL history, is memorialized in and outside
                                        of the ballpark. It’s also the most transit-friendly ballpark in the majors,
                                        accessible via car, train, bus, bike, boat and ridesharing. This is the ballpark
                                        that originally gave us garlic fries and it still offers a distinctive food
                                        program. (2018 rank: #2)</p>

                                <p>#4 Fenway Park The oldest ballpark in the majors, Fenway Park still retains a high
                                        amount of old-time charm. We all focus on the areas that have been updated in
                                        the past decade—the Green Monster seating, the right-field corner seating, the
                                        renovated center-field food area—but there’s lots to Fenway Park that’s
                                        authentically vintage, and it’s those areas we love. Yes, the concourses are
                                        cramped, the seats are ill-designed for the modern posterior, and parking is a
                                        nightmare. Having said that, a game at Fenway Park is an essential baseball
                                        experience and should be on every fan’s bucket list. (2018 rank: #4)</p>

                                <p>#5 Target Field Walt Disney once said that Disneyland would never be completed, as it
                                        would grow and change as long as there is imagination left in the world. And
                                        while Target Field is hardly Disneyesque, the Minnesota Twins do show the
                                        inclination to make annual upgrades to the ballpark. Last year saw the major
                                        conversion of a private dining space for season-ticket holders to a public
                                        social space—a sports bar on steroids to enhance the ballpark experience—and
                                        this season saw the addition of a “living” batter’s eye and a new outdoor space
                                        with pop-up vendors and kids’ activities. Add in plenty of Minnesota connections
                                        on the food and beverage front, great sightlines, plenty of discrete seating
                                        areas for all kinds of fans, and an abundance of spots just for standing around
                                        to watch a ballgame, and you have a pretty good blueprint for new and renovated
                                        ballparks of all kinds. (2018 rank: #5))</p>

                                <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers will complete $100 million in renovations prior to the 2020 season. A new center field plaza will feature food and beverage areas, along with a children’s play area, and space for live entertainment. Fans will access the plaza through a new outfield entryway (shown above), where a relocated Jackie Robinson statue—moving from its current location in the left-field reserve plaza—will be on prominent display. Connectivity is also a major part of the renovations. Elevators and escalators will allow fans in all parts of Dodger Stadium to access the new plaza, while bridges will be incorporated to connect new outfield standing room areas to the rest of the ballpark. Plans also call for a replacement of the speaker tower in center field, as well as new restrooms in the left and right-field pavilions, and enclosed bars that will give fans an up-close look at the bullpens. Seating upgrades are also on tap, with improved options for fans with disabilities and new home run seats—to be placed in front of existing pavilion seating—set to be installed.)</p>

Dubbed the Press Club, the space will feature a mixture of seating options that include four-top tables, extra wide theatre-style seating, and high-top chairs. In addition, the club space will offer include all-inclusive food and beverages; a fully stocked bar that serves a broad selection of bourbon, beer, wine and spirits; high-end food options with customizable offerings, and in-seat service. The addition of the Press Club is not the only change coming to Great American Ball Park, as the Reds will create space for working media members down the third-base side on the Suite Level and are expected to install a new videoboard.</p>

                                <p>In the 2020 season, the Milwaukee Brewers will debut Miller Lite Landing–a space in the left-center field Loge Level that offers three rows of seating with tables, a viewing deck with charging stations, flat screen high definition TVs and a seven-foot Brewers logo made of Miller Lite cans, providing what should be a sought-after selfie spot. In addition, the viewing deck will include cold drink holders that are built into the rails. Elsewhere in the ballpark, the former Miller Lite Deck will be rebranded as the Leinie Lodge, while a Terrapin Beer Company bar is set to debut later in the season.</p>
